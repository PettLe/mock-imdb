This is the final project of The Odin Project's fullstack curriculum's JavaScript section. I will be creating my own mock version of Internet Movie Database (IMDb).
It will utilize most of the techs and techniques previously learned, such as React, Firebase, API calls (OMDb API probably), React Router, async functions etc. Also I try to use new things such as Reactfire, and things I know and have practiced but not used nearly enough, like Jest for testing.

This WILL take a long time. There WILL be frustrations. But like with previous projects, all those WILL be overcome. (As a note to future me.)
My goal is at this point for the web app to have at least most of these functions:

- Listing of newest and most popular movies
- Ratings
- Info (director, plot, actors, etc.)
- Possibility to use Google Auth to sign in and create own reviews and lists

---

Notes: The API I'm using seems to allow only fetching one specific movie at a time. So not flexible enough. Have to explore other possibilities, if there's not a
workaround. => It might still be possible.

The rendering seems to work now. It was fixed with simple extra tag (not tied to API calls), so that the page never tried to render completely empty page.

---

Further notes: I deviated from this project for now. Updates on the The Odin Project Curriculum added and moved new content, some of which is supposed to come before this final project. As I was already pretty much stuck with this one, I very much welcomed this break. I also think that I need to ditch this project for time being, and eventually start it from the scratch. I really like the idea of this web app. But, for the TOP final JS project, I may need to undertake a different kind of web app. Something little less ambitious.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
